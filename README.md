## Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

My name's **Adam**, and I'm a '23 graduate of UCF & its Burnett Honors College, where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I'll be working as a Software Engineer post-grad.

I love working on programming projects, so feel free to take a look at my work, and check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-n-fernandes/) if you'd like to connect. Have a great day! ðŸ™‚
